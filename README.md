# awesome-humanoid-Manipulation [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of resources relevant to humanoid-object interaction.

Given the relevance between humanoid manipulation and dexterous bimanual manipulation, we have included some works on dexterous bimanual manipulation.

Recent months witnessed animated and simulated humanoids becoming a main approach towards coordinated manipulations. It is a large step towards full-body humanoid manipulation, thus is included.
