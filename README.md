# awesome-humanoid-Manipulation [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of resources relevant to humanoid-object interaction.

Given the relevance between humanoid manipulation and dexterous bimanual manipulation, we have included some works on dexterous bimanual manipulation.

Recent months witnessed teleoperation-based humanoid learning becoming a main approach towards coordinated humanoid manipulation.
